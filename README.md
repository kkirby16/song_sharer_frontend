# Javascript Project - Song Sharer

I built Song Sharer so that it's a Single Page Application with a Javascript frontend and a Rails API backend.

I've always been passionate about music and so many genres of it. It is fun to share songs with people you know in person and hear their song suggestions- I've found many of my favorite songs doing so.

However, I've always thought there should be a popular app specifically for sharing songs with others you know. There are well known apps like this for sharing other resources, but not really for sharing favorite songs for others to see.<br><br>

## Overview of functionality:

This application allows you to:

-See all songs that have been posted (Read) along with their urls and the name of the person they were submitted by

-Post songs you like onto the website for others to see (Create)

-See the genres our website has as categories along with their descriptions (Read).

Additionally, I've added custom CSS to style my frontend.

## Built with:

-JavaScript and use of Object Oriented JavaScript

-Ruby on Rails API

-Custom CSS

-Asynchronous client-server communication using JSON as the communication format

-Rails MVC pattern and RESTful conventions

-HTML

## To install and run:

-I have two repos that you need to get into to run my site: a backend repo and a frontend one

-Fork and clone the backend repository at this link: https://github.com/kkirby16/song_sharer_backend

-Once in the program, open the terminal and run bundle install.

-Next, run rake db:migrate and rake db:seed.

-Then, run rails s in the terminal.

-Next, fork and clone the frontend repository at this link: https://github.com/kkirby16/song_sharer_frontend

-Run open index.html in the terminal and you will see the site open in the browser.

## How to use the site:

### Video of how to use my app: https://youtu.be/WlAL8AUhsrk

### Or, instructions below:

-Fear not, the site is simple to use. Once you're on the site you can:

-See songs that are listed on the right side of the screen, as well as seeing their song urls and the name of the person they've been submitted by. Just scroll in the box that contains the songs.

-Post a new song to the site with the form on the left side of the screen. Once song info is filled in and the share button is pressed, your song will be added to the top of the posted songs list.

-Click the button for seeing genres to view the genre categories our site has along with their descriptions. You can scroll in this box to see all of that information. To hide this box click the button in the same place that you clicked to see the genres. To show the genres again, click that button which has now changed to be a button to show the genres. You can click this as much as you want to hide/show genres and their descriptions.
